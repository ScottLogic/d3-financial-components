__A collection of components that make it easy to build interactive charts with D3.__

## Installation and Documentation

For details of installation and general usage, visit the [d3fc project webpage](http://d3fc.io/).

When making changes to a package, you can execute the following either from within the package folder to build just that package or from the project root to build all packages.
~~~
npm run bundle

To open a development sandbox which is automatically updated when you save changes to source files, navigate to the project root and run
~~~
npm start
