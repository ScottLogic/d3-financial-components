title: Pixel Aligned Linear Scale
---

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-8">
		<p>The 'Pixel Aligned Linear Scale' is a direct replacement for the `d3.scale.linear` component. No additional parameters are necessary.</p>
		<p>The function of this component is to provide crisper graphics when rendering the chart. Based on the D3 component, the vertical and horizontal gridlines and data points are drawn at a calculated position which is not rounded to a whole number. This means that antialiasing occurs on the SVG canvas.</p>
		<p>This component rounds the calculated pixel to the nearest half pixel for the line centre. Therefore a vertical line of 1 pixel thickness will be perfectly aligned in the pixel column and not spread out over two or more pixel columns by the antialiaser.</p>
		<p>The diagram illustrates this. Notice the vertical grid line is 'pixel aligned', but the horizontal line is antialiased.</p>
