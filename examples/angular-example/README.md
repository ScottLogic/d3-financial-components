D3 Financial Components - AngularJS Example
===============================================

The components have been wrapped in a basic [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) SPA (Single Page Application) to demonstrate their use. 

AngularJS and the App
---------------------

For documentation on AngularJS you can refer to their website [here](https://angularjs.org/) or on [GitHub here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js).

The controller for this demo is in the 'controllers' folder (js/controllers/scottLogicChartCtrl.js), the accompanying partial file is 'inc/scottLogicChart.html'.

This project also uses require.js and some other common Javascript projects. These script are included in the 'js/dist' folder.

Getting Started
---------------

This example should run in a Node.js http-server or another web server. 

Opening the index.html file directly in a browser will cause Cross Site Scripting warnings.

The index.html file can be opened directly in Chrome if Chrome is started with the "--args --disable-web-security --allow-file-access-from-files" arguments, but this is not the recommended approach.
